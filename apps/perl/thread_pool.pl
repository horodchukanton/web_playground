#  DESCRIPTION: script comparing job processing done by one thread and a pool
#               of threads. 
#
#               The task is to add numbers stored one per line in files in a particular
#               directory. 
#
#               Jobs (job == file to process) are added to a job queue, from which they are
#               taken one by one by a thread that is available to do the work.
#               Both implementations are non-blocking.
#
#               two implementations:
#                   a) no pool/one thread only:
#                           one work queue and one thread taking jobs put on the work queue
#                   b) a pool of threads, that are taking jobs off a work queue
